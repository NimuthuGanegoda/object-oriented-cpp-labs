# object-oriented-cpp-labs

A quick C++ template for modern CMake projects, aimed to be an easy to use
starting point.


This project is based on the modern-cpp-template and adapted for object-oriented-cpp-labs.

## Features

* Modern **CMake** configuration and project, which, to the best of my
knowledge, uses the best practices,

* An example of a **Clang-Format** config, inspired from the base *Google* model,
with minor tweaks. This is aimed only as a starting point, as coding style
is a subjective matter, everyone is free to either delete it (for the *LLVM*
default) or supply their own alternative,

* **Static analyzers** integration, with *Clang-Tidy* and *Cppcheck*, the former
being the default option,

* **Doxygen** support, through the `ENABLE_DOXYGEN` option, which you can enable
if you wish to use it,

* **Unit testing** support, through *GoogleTest* (with an option to enable
*GoogleMock*) or *Catch2*,

* **Code coverage**, enabled by using the `ENABLE_CODE_COVERAGE` option, through
*Codecov* CI integration,

* **Package manager support**, with *Conan* and *Vcpkg*, through their respective
options

* **CI workflows for Windows, Linux and MacOS** using *GitHub Actions*, making
use of the caching features, to ensure minimum run time,

* **.md templates** for: *README*, *Contributing Guideliness*,
*Issues* and *Pull Requests*,

* **Permissive license** to allow you to integrate it as easily as possible. The
template is licensed under the [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/),

* Options to build as a header-only library or executable, not just a static or
shared library.

* **Ccache** integration, for speeding up rebuild times

## Getting Started

You can build and run this repo entirely remotely without installing toolchains on your host using VS Code Dev Containers or GitHub Codespaces. A `.devcontainer` configuration and `Dockerfile` are included, and a build script automates configuration and tests.

### Prerequisites (host build)

This project is meant to be only a template, thus versions of the software used
can be change to better suit the needs of the developer(s). If you wish to use the
template *as-is*, meaning using the versions recommended here, then you will need:

* **CMake v3.15+** - found at [https://cmake.org/](https://cmake.org/)

* **C++ Compiler** - needs to support at least the **C++17** standard, i.e. *MSVC*,
*GCC*, *Clang*

> ***Note:*** *You also need to be able to provide ***CMake*** a supported
[generator](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html).*

### Installing (template instructions)

It is fairly easy to install the project, all you need to do is clone if from
[GitHub](https://github.com/filipdutescu/modern-cpp-template) or
[generate a new repository from it](https://github.com/filipdutescu/modern-cpp-template/generate)
(also on **GitHub**).

If you wish to clone the repository, rather than generate from it, you simply need
to run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/filipdutescu/modern-cpp-template/
```

After finishing getting a copy of the project, with any of the methods above, create
a new folder in the `include/` folder, with the name of your project.  Edit
`cmake/SourcesAndHeaders.cmake` to add your files.


You will also need to rename the `cmake/ProjectConfig.cmake.in` file to `cmake/ObjectOrientedCppLabsConfig.cmake.in`.
Update the GitHub workflows to use `-DOBJECT_ORIENTED_CPP_LABS_ENABLE_CODE_COVERAGE=1`.


Finally, change the project name in `CMakeLists.txt` to `object-oriented-cpp-labs`.

To install an already built project, you need to run the `install` target with CMake.
For example:

```bash
cmake --build build --target install --config Release

# a more general syntax for that command is:
cmake --build <build_directory> --target install --config <desired_config>
```

## Building the project

To build the project, all you need to do, ***after correctly
[installing the project](README.md#Installing)***, is run a similar **CMake** routine
to the the one below:

```bash
mkdir build/ && cd build/
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/absolute/path/to/custom/install/directory
cmake --build . --target install
```

### Remote container build (Dev Containers / Codespaces)

```bash
# Open in VS Code and use: Dev Containers: Reopen in Container
# or start a GitHub Codespace. The container builds automatically.

# To run the build manually inside the container:
./scripts/build_and_test.sh
```

### Run executable (if enabled)

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -Dobject-oriented-cpp-labs_BUILD_EXECUTABLE=ON
cmake --build build --config Debug
./build/bin/Debug/object-oriented-cpp-labs 2 3 || ./build/bin/object-oriented-cpp-labs 2 3
```

> ***Note:*** *The custom ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` can be omitted if you wish to
install in [the default install location](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/GNUInstallDirs.html).*

More options that you can set for the project can be found in the
[`cmake/StandardSettings.cmake` file](cmake/StandardSettings.cmake). For certain
options additional configuration may be needed in their respective `*.cmake` files
(i.e. Conan needs the `CONAN_REQUIRES` and might need the `CONAN_OPTIONS` to be setup
for it work correctly; the two are set in the [`cmake/Conan.cmake` file](cmake/Conan.cmake)).

## Generating the documentation

In order to generate documentation for the project, you need to configure the build
to use Doxygen. This is easily done, by modifying the workflow shown above as follows:

```bash
mkdir build/ && cd build/
cmake .. -D<project_name>_ENABLE_DOXYGEN=1 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/absolute/path/to/custom/install/directory
cmake --build . --target doxygen-docs
```

> ***Note:*** *This will generate a `docs/` directory in the **project's root directory**.*

## Running the tests

By default, the template uses [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest/)
for unit testing. Unit testing can be disabled in the options, by setting the
`ENABLE_UNIT_TESTING` (from
[cmake/StandardSettings.cmake](cmake/StandardSettings.cmake)) to be false. To run
the tests, simply use CTest, from the build directory, passing the desire
configuration for which to run tests for. An example of this procedure is:

```bash
cd build          # if not in the build directory already
ctest -C Release  # or `ctest -C Debug` or any other configuration you wish to test

# you can also run tests with the `-VV` flag for a more verbose output (i.e.
#GoogleTest output as well)
```
